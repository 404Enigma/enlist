<h2>What's our project? 📒</h2>

#### ~ We have created a To-do List which allows a list of shared tasks within the class.

#### ~ We use realtime database to sync all the tasks in everybody's account.

&nbsp;

## Code Footnotes:

- [Android App](https://github.com/404Enigma/enlist-app)
- [Web App](https://github.com/404Enigma/enlist-web)
- [Data Analysis](https://github.com/404Enigma/enlist-data-analysis)

&nbsp;

<h2>Salient Features 🧩</h2>

#### ~ The task added by anyone in that class will automatically appear in your list so that you get to know what is given.

#### ~ User analysis via Python. Through this we make a log sheet to track every user's activity.

#### ~ You can directly sync your task to Google Calendar. Hence, you will get notification , pop-up reminders and add other Google features.

#### ~ PERSONAL & SHARED feature:

- If any user wants to keep the task to himself then (s)he can add using the PERSONAL feature. So, that task won't appear in other people's lists.
- If any user wants to share the task to the whole team/class, then (s)he can add using the SHARED feature. Hence, it will automatically sync to everyone's list.
- Edit, done and delete operations on a particular task are individual for everyone and the changes made by that user won't occur in other people's list.

#### ~ Website and Android App are dynamic i.e., the changes made on any of the platform are synced automatically via Firebase.

#### ~ We have made a two-fold security factor via PRN (roll call) and College ID. So, both of them should match.

#### ~ User can register via College ID only. Also user is granted access for only his/her respective classes.

&nbsp;

<h2>Interfuse 😎</h2>

#### Our platform is easily accessible both on Website and Android App. You can perform the operations on any of the platform according to your convenience.
